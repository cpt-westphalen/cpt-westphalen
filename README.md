## ðŸŒ± sup, I'm @cpt-westphalen, from southern Brazil.
* You can call me **Rodrigo** or **Captain** _(it's ironic),_ or **CÃ£o**, if you'd like (but you probably can't pronounce that, lol).
* I'm into complex problems, communication (I'm a journalism student, also), sustainability, personal and social development.
* My ongoing studies are on **JavaScript**, which I really like _- and yes, as you might have guessed r/n, I have a history of drug abuse._ 
  * React | junior lvl
  * Node.js | scratching the surface
  * Next.js | yet to start
* I'm seeking for projects that deals with agroforesty, education, community technology, clean energy and ecological solutions.

## Checkout what I'm working on:

### NLW 2022 - FIND YOUR DUO [(link)](https://github.com/cpt-westphalen/nlw-ignite-2022)

Rocketseat's Next Level Week project - but it's my code.

### TDD VITE CRUD [(link)](https://github.com/cpt-westphalen/tdd-vite-windi-crud)

Testing a few technologies on the same project: Vite for React, test-driven development with Vitest and WindiCSS. The CRUD part is yet to be made, tho'.

### LEFTNIX [(link)](https://github.com/cpt-westphalen/leftnix)

My first project, still a work in progress. I hate the fact that every time I come back to it I recall how much refactoring it needs. Also, I didn't start with Tailwind, or TS, or even Vite, so it's kinda a mess, but it will be great someday.
